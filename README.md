## Mission

In the history of [`SASTRA DEEMED To Be University`](https://www.sastra.edu) has always been top in using technologies and resources.
Yet, timetable for classes has been calculated manually (atleast until `Jan 2025`).
Such complex and mundane tasks should be automated; focusing on the main tasks, not spending time on scheduling classes.

In short, this project aims at automating timetable generation using the data stored in the database, with no conflict of classes (which was never a problem).
