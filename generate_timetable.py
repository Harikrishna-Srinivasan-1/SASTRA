Assumptions made: * There are two lunch break, one at P-4 and other at P-5.
				    Either of which can be left out for lunch (mostly not both).
				  * Lab hour (or practical) only start at odd period and spans 2 periods continuously. (For all course with P > 0).
				  Sample Periods:
                       1            2           3           4           5           6           7           8
				  08:45-09:45  09:45-10:45 11:00-12:00 12:00-01:00 01:00-02:00 02:00-03:00 03:15-04:15 04:15-05:15
				  E.g., Lab hour may start at Period 5 (i.e., at 01:00) and end at 03:00
				  * First, allotted for core non-elective courses
				  * Manually, call generate timetable for Major Electives.
				  (So that can be allotted at same time for all).
				  * For Minor Electives also call the generate timetable manually.
Considerations:  * while (no_of_times_allotted)*Class capacity < Student Strength:
					* Allocate # no_of_times_allotted = 0, initially
